		RUMOURS
			</block><block type="text">
Only a foolhardy adventurer would embark upon
such a perilous quest without first finding out as
much as possible about the mountain and its
treasures. Before your arrival at the foot of Firetop
Mountain, you spent several days with the humble
townsfolk of a local village some two days' joumey
from the base. Being a likeable sort of person, you
found it easy to get on with the local peasants.
Although they told many stories about the myster-
ious Warlock's sanctuary, you could not feel sure that
all - or indeed any of these were based on fact. The
villagers had seen many adventurers pass through on
their way to the mountain, but very few ever
returned. The journey ahead was extremely danger-
ous, that you knew for certain. Of those who returned
Firetop Mountain.

to the village, none contemplated going back to
There seemed to be some truth in the rumour that the
Warlock's treasure was stored in a magnificent chest
with two locks, and the keys to these locks were
guarded by various creatures within the dungeons.
The Warlock himself was a sorcerer of great power.
Some described him as old, others as young. Some
said his power came from an enchanted deck of cards,
others from the silky black gloves that he wore.

The entrance to the mountain was guarded by a pack
of warty-faced Goblins, stupid creatures, fond of their
food and drink. Towards the inner chambers, the
creatures became more fearsome. To reach the inner
chambers you would have to cross a river. The ferry
service was regular, but the ferryman enjoyed a good
barter, so you should save a Gold Piece for the trip.
The locals also encouraged you to keep a good map of
your wanderings, for without a map you would end
up hopelessly lost within the mountain.
When it finally came to your day of leaving, the
whole village turned out to wish you a safe journey.
Tears came to the eyes of many of the women, young
and old alike. You couldn't help wondering whether
they were tears of sorrow shed by eyes which would
never see you alive again...
Now turn over.

At last your two-day hike is over. You unsheathe
your sword, lay it on the ground and sigh with relief
as you lower yourself down on to the mossy rocks to
sit for a moment's rest. You stretch, rub your eyes
and finally look up at Firetop Mountain.
The very mountain itself looks menacing. The steep
face in front of you looks to have been savaged by
the claws of some gargantuan beast. Sharp rocky
crags jut out at unnatural angles. At the top of the
mountain you can see the eerie red colouring -
probably some strange vegetation - which has given
the mountain its name. Perhaps no one will ever
know exactly what grows up there, as climbing the
peak must surely be impossible.
Your quest lies ahead of you. Across the clearing is a
dark cave entrance. You pick up your sword, get to
your feet and consider what dangers may lie ahead
of you. But with determination, you thrust the
sword home into its scabbard and approach the
cave.
You peer into the gloom to see dark, slimy walls
with pools of water on the stone floor in front of
you. The air is cold and dank. You light your lantern
and step warily into the blackness. Cobwebs brush
your face and you hear the scurrying of tiny feet:
rats, most likely. You set off into the cave. After a
few yards you arrive at a junction. Will you turn
west or east?

The bell gives a dull clang and after a few moments
you see a withered old man climb into a small row-
ing boat moored on the north bank. He rows slowly
across to you, moors the boat and limps towards
you. He asks you for 3 Gold Pieces. When you
protest at the price he mumbles some flimsy excuse
about 'inflation'. He begins to get angry at your
protestations. Do you pay him the 3 Gold Pieces
or threaten him?

The box contains a small leather-bound book
entitled The Making and Casting of Dragonfire. You
open the pages and begin to read. Fortunately it is
written in your own language and so was probably
not understood by the Orcs - otherwise this treas-
ure would certainly not be as loosely guarded as it
was.

Di Maggio. In it he tells the story of his life's work;
the creation of the Dragonfire spell with which to
And
fight evil Dragons. You read how, in his last years,
Farrigo finally perfected his spell but by then was
too old to make use of it. So he completed his book,
locked it in a chest and hid it in the depths of Firetop
Mountain, afraid that it might fall into the wrong
hands. The last page reads:
nd so you who now hold

The power of destruction is
yours if you wish it, but do not
waste it. Unless you use the
Spell for the purpose for which

die by the fire from your own
hands.Remember, only when

Tanu over to discover what lies
within the Warlock's chest

The Warlock of Firetop Mountain is no more and
you are now the owner of the Sorcerer's riches. At
least a thousand Gold Pieces, jewellery, diamonds,
rubies and pearls are in the chest. Hidden under
these you find the Warlock's spell book and as you
leaf through the pages, you realize that this tome is
probably more valuable than all the treasure.
Instructions are given for the control of all the
secrets - and the creatures of Firetop Mountain.
With this book, unlimited power is yours and the
safety of your return to the village is ensured. Or, if
you would prefer, you could remain as master of the
domain of Firetop Mountain
